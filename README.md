ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aman Barthria
Aspiring Data Analyst | Skilled in Excel, SQL, Power BI & Python | Career Transition from Finance to Analytics

I'm a results-oriented and detail-driven data enthusiast passionate about solving real-world problems through the power of data. With a strong foundation in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python, I specialize in extracting insights that drive smarter business decisions.

My journey began in finance, where I developed a sharp eye for data accuracy and business impact. Now, I apply those same principles to data analyticsâ€”delivering performance dashboards, sales insights, and automation tools to make data accessible and actionable.

I believe in low ego, high ownership, and continuous learning. My approach is simple: understand the problem, work hard to solve it, and let the results speak.

Letâ€™s connect to explore how I can bring clarity to your data and value to your team.
